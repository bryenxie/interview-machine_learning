a cheat-sheet i made for my ML/AI interview


### Supervised Learning:
Supervised Learning is where you have input(x) and output(y) and you use algorithems try to mapping your function  y = f(x).

#### Two type of supervised learning :

Classification: To predict the outcome of a given sample where the output variable is in the form of categories. Examples include labels such as male and female, sick and healthy.

Regression: To predict the outcome of a given sample where the output variable is in the form of real numbers. Examples include real-valued labels denoting the amount of rainfall, the height of a person.

Famous examples:

Linear Regression 
Logistic Regression 
CART (Classification And Regression Trees )
Na√Øve Bayes 
KNN (k-nearest neighbours)


### Unsupervised learning :

Unsupervised learning : is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output(Y) variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.

Unsupervised learning can be grouped to two types of problems:

Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping students by their study behaviour.

Association:  An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that take CS courses also tend to take Math courses.

Dimensionality Reduction : 

Famous examples:
 Apriori, 
 K-means, 
 PCA
